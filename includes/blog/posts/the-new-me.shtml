<section class="post-content">
  <p>March 31, 2016 was my last day at <a href="http://www.deshaw.com" target="_blank">D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Shaw&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co.</a>. I had worked for 15 years, creating, designing, developing, managing, troubleshooting, supporting, fixing and improving software that was meant to either support software or people who support software. It was time for a change. While DESCO was a great company to work at, the heart yearned for a more personal connection with real people. I wanted to create software and media for solving problems faced by real people. The time had come to strike out on my own and what I can make of my skills as a design engineer.</p>
